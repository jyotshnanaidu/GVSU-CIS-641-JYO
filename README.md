# Team Name: JYO
A random password generator with user-defined length is a useful tool that enhances security by creating strong, unpredictable passwords. Users can specify the length of the password based on their needs, which ensures flexibility for various applications, from simple accounts to complex systems that require stronger protection. The generated password usually consists of a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, making it resistant to brute-force attacks and harder to guess.
